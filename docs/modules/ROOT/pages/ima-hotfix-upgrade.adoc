= Denali IMA hotfix upgrade steps

Because some part of IMA code was performing worse than expected engineering updated ima agent code as well as schain and skale-admin containers with the hot fix. You will see the following version bumps:

* ima: `1.0.0-stable.0` -> `1.0.0-beta.11`
* schain: `3.7.3-stable.0` -> `3.7.4-beta-hotfix.0`
* admin: `2.0.1` -> `2.0.1-beta.3`

Also make sure `DISABLE_IMA` is set to `False`.
