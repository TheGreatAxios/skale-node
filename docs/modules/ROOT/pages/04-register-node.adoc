== Register Node in SKALE Network

=== Register Node with Node CLI

[IMPORTANT]
Before proceeding, you will need to have at least  **1 Goerli ETH**. Also amount of delegated skale tokens need to be more or equal to minimum staking amount.

To register with the network, you will need to provide the following:

-  Node name
-  Machine public IP
-  Domain name

```shell
sudo skale node register --name [NODE_NAME] --ip [NODE_IP] --domain [DOMAIN_NAME]

```

**Output:**

```shell
Node registered in SKALE manager. For more info run: skale node info
```

=== Check Node Status

You can check the status of your node, and ensure that it's properly registered with the SKALE Network.

```shell
sudo skale node info
```

**Output:**

```shell
# Node info
Name: <Node name>
ID: <Node ID>
IP: <IP of Machine>
Public IP: <Public IP of Machine>
Port: <Node port>
Domain name: <Node domain name>
Status: Active
```
